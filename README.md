## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:15.2
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

5. Close the database connection:
```
\q
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL queries to achieve the following results (You need to write the query in the section `Your query here` on each question):

1. Total money of all the accounts group by types.

```
select a.type, sum(mount) from accounts a group by a.type 
```


2. How many users with at least 2 `CURRENT_ACCOUNT`.

```
select u.name, u.id, count(a.id) count from users u left join accounts a on u.id = a.user_id  group by u.id having count(a.id) > 1
```


3. List the top five accounts with more money.

```
select a.id, a.mount from accounts a order by a.mount desc limit 5;
```


4. Get the three users with the most money after making movements.

```
WITH sum_summary AS (
    WITH movements_summary AS (
        SELECT
            a.id AS account_id,
            a.mount as original_amount,
            
            m.type,
            CASE
                WHEN m.type = 'IN' THEN m.mount
                WHEN m.type NOT IN ('IN', 'TRANSFER') THEN -m.mount
                WHEN m.type = 'TRANSFER' AND m.account_from = a.id THEN -m.mount
                WHEN m.type = 'TRANSFER' AND m.account_to = a.id THEN m.mount
                ELSE a.mount
            END AS after_movements
        FROM
            accounts a
        INNER JOIN movements m
            ON a.id = m.account_to OR a.id = m.account_from
        ORDER BY
            after_movements
    )
    SELECT account_id, original_amount+ SUM(after_movements) AS final_movements
    FROM movements_summary
    GROUP BY account_id, original_amount
    ORDER BY final_movements DESC
)
SELECT u.id, sum(final_movements) as result
FROM sum_summary ss
inner join accounts a 
on ss.account_id = a.id
inner join users u
on a.user_id  = u.id
group by u.id
order by result desc limit 3
```


5. In this part you need to create a transaction with the following steps:

    a. First, get the ammount for the account `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` and `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` after all their movements.
